# Parallax-Effects

## Motivation
I built this page in order to practice CSS and get a better understanding about how to create good looking parallax effects(I always liked them, although they are very 2000's now </3 ) 

## Credits
The code is based on the [Parallax on the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwoa-9jxi0&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IyCbhul-PdeiDqmh4ooJzk) playlist from the [Dev Tips](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ) youtube channel.
